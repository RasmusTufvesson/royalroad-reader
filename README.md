# Royal Road reader
This is a program i made with rust and tauri that lets you read Royal Road stories and download them for reading later. This is purely for personal use but it should work fine for anyone.

# Icons
The icons (under src/assets/) are taken from [Material Design](https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign/tree/master) and are under the Apache 2.0 license.

# Todo
* Add a way to update chapters and stories after they are downloaded
* Add a way to mass redownload chapters
* Make the program not crash when trying to download a chapter that no longer exists
* Add a way to remove or hide author notes
